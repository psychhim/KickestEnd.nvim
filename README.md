Neovim Custom Keymaps


A collection of custom keymaps for Neovim aimed at improving productivity, navigation, and clipboard management. These keymaps are written in Lua for Neovim ≥0.7 and include enhanced visual/normal mode operations, smart buffer/file handling, and more.


Features


[[ Navigation ]]


Smooth scrolling with centered cursor: <leader>j / <leader>k

Enhanced search: n / N keeps cursor centered

Move lines visually: J / K in visual mode

Switch between splits quickly: <leader><Tab> / <Tab>


[[ Buffer & File Management ]]

Smart buffer switch using Telescope: <leader><leader>

Smart file open (gf) reuses empty buffers or opens in a new tab

Create new empty buffers in splits or tabs:

Horizontal: <leader>sv

Vertical: <leader>sh

New tab: <leader>e

Save buffers safely:

<leader>w — Save current buffer (prompts if new)

<leader>qy — Save and quit

<leader>qn — Quit without saving


[[ Clipboard & Copying ]]

Copy current line: Y (normal mode)

Copy selection: Y (visual mode, trims extra newlines)

Select all and copy: <leader>lY (entire buffer without trailing newline)

Paste from clipboard: <leader>P (at cursor, or over selection without yanking it)

Notifications when content is copied to clipboard


[[ Diagnostics ]]

[d] / ]d — Navigate diagnostics

<leader>de — Open diagnostic floating window

<leader>dq — Set location list for diagnostics


[[ Misc ]]

Reselect last visual selection after moving lines

Better word wrap handling: j / k intelligently move through wrapped lines

Smart J in normal mode joins lines without moving cursor

Paste over selection without yanking replaced text: <leader>p
