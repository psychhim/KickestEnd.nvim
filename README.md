## Neovim Custom Keymaps

A collection of custom keymaps for Neovim aimed at improving buffer handling, navigation and clipboard management. These keymaps are written in Lua for Neovim ≥0.7 and include enhanced smart buffer/file handling and more.

---

## Features

### Navigation

- Smooth scrolling with centered cursor: `<leader>j` / `<leader>k`
- Enhanced search: `n` / `N` keeps cursor centered
- Move lines visually: `J` / `K` in visual mode
- Switch between splits quickly: `<leader><Tab>` / `<Tab>`

### Buffer Management

- Smart buffer switch using Telescope: `<leader><leader>`
- Better buffer handling with Neotree and Telescope pickers:
  - Open files in new tabs by default.
  - Open file in split mode by pressing `h` or `v` on the file.
- Create new empty buffers in splits or tabs:
  - Horizontal: `<leader>sv`
  - Vertical: `<leader>sh`
  - New tab: `<leader>e`
- Better visual editor like saving:
  - `<leader>w` — Save current buffer (prompts if new)
  - `<leader>W` — Save As (prompts if new)
- Better safe closing:
- `<leader>qy` — Save and quit
  - `<leader>qn` — Quit without saving

### Clipboard & Copying

- Copy current line: `Y` (normal mode)
- Copy selection: `Y` (visual mode, trims extra newlines)
- Select all and copy: `<leader>lY` (entire buffer without trailing newline)
- Paste from clipboard: `<leader>P` (at cursor, or over selection without yanking it)
- Paste over selection without yanking replaced text: `<leader>p`

### Diagnostics

- `[d` / `]d` — Navigate diagnostics
- `<leader>de` — Open diagnostic floating window
- `<leader>dq` — Set location list for diagnostics
